          answer: "Book formatting is the process of arranging your manuscript’s text and visuals in a way that meets publishing standards and offers the best reading experience. Proper formatting ensures consistent font usage, spacing, headers, chapter breaks, and pagination, which ultimately makes your book easier to read and more professional. Poor formatting can cause a reader to disengage, so this step is as crucial as writing or editing.",

        {
          question: "Do I need different formatting for print and ebook?",
          answer: "Yes, and that’s where our book formatting services come in. Print books require fixed layouts, specific trim sizes, and margins, while ebooks need reflowable formats that adjust to screen sizes. We format your manuscript for both so it looks great no matter how it’s read.",

        {
          question: "What’s the difference between formatting and editing?",
